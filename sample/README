NAME
    apid example usage

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple API interface to a hosts processes. It uses apid and
    "ps". It consits of two parts, the apid uri map ps.pm and a client
    interface index.html which uses Jquery to access the interface.

USAGE
    Once apid is installed, start the server like this:

     cd sample/
     apid -c ps.conf -f start

    Then point your browser to <http://localhost:8080/>. The uri / will be
    served with the mentioned index.html. A process listing should appear
    immediately. You can click on a process to see more details and you can
    search for processes.

INTERNALS
    The uri map uses authentication for some uris (basic authentication),
    which is transparent if you access it via index.html. The jquery script
    authenticates to the api with the first request. Since apid returns a
    session cookie, subsequent requests don't require additional measures.

SECURITY
    Please don't run this example on an internet facing server. It displays
    all processes which is dangerous if third parties can view them.
